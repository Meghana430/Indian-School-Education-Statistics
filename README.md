## Overview 🌐

This project analyses a dataset from the Indian Government's Open Government Data (OGD) Platform India, covering essential statistics of Indian School Education from 2013-2014 to 2015-2016. The data provides insights into various aspects of the educational infrastructure such as the availability of electricity and computers, gross enrollment ratios, dropout rates, and the provision of gender-specific amenities like boys' and girls' toilets across different states and union territories.

## Introduction 👩‍🏫

The dataset includes seven CSV files, each detailing specific aspects of school education across India, such as the percentage of schools with drinking water, electricity, and other facilities. Users can explore data concerning state-wise dropout ratios, gender-specific amenities, and enrollment patterns at different levels of schooling.
